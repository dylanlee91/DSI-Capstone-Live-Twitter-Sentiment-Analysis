    "Sports fans generate a great deal of opinionated data in response to what is happening during various sporting events. In this data there are both discrete topics and sentiments associated with each topic. To investigate the ability of NLP to model and provide insights on collected social media sentiment, I tested this by collecting and examining topics and sentiment during a specific football event. The data was cleaned to leave only basic english characters and words stripped of stopwords, lemmatized, and tokenized. The tweets were then assigned a sentiment score based on the tokens identified, before they were run through an unsupervised latent Dirichlet allocation model to identify and assign topics to the tweets. \n",

    "3. The tweet text was cleaned to leave only raw english words \n",
    "4. The tweet search term included english only tweets, so langdetect was not needed.\n",
    "5. Because of the nature of twitter and mispelling player names, to preserve player names as a topic, regex was used to identify any words where player names had extra letters. For example, 'WATKINSSSS' returned 'watkins' after regex.\n",
    "6. The cleaned text was tokenized and lemmatized, then saved to a dataframe.\n",
    "7. Term tokens were also saved for later visualisation."
