# ![alt text](https://github.com/dylanlee91/DSI-Ames-Housing/blob/main/ga_logo.png?raw=true) Capstone Project: Using Live Twitter Scraping to visualize real time changes in fan sentiment

## Executive Summary
Sports fans generate a great deal of opinionated data in response to what is happening during various sporting events. In this data there are both discrete topics and sentiments associated with each topic. To investigate the ability of NLP to model and provide insights on collected social media sentiment, I tested this by collecting and examining topics and sentiment during a specific football event. The data was cleaned to leave only basic english characters and words stripped of stopwords, lemmatized, and tokenized. The tweets were then assigned a sentiment score based on the tokens identified, before they were run through an unsupervised latent Dirichlet allocation model to identify and assign topics to the tweets. 
The results do provide insight into fan sentiment during the chosen event and that my approach was effective in answering the initial problem statement

## Problem Statement
How can we use social media as an aggregator of topics and sentiment in user discussions? To investigate this, I used tweets posted over the course of a real time event and checked to see how sentiment and topics occurrence changed in response to discrete smaller events over the period.
