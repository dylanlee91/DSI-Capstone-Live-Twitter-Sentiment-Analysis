Liverpool fully deserved to win. We might complain about Mane, or Jota handball, but facts are facts. What I will say is that it is extremely rare for us to have some hope vs a top 6 side away in the last 10 mins of a game, that's a new feeling. As for ""oh Arteta's just parking the bus"", well if you look at the defensive set-up and compare it to say City's vs Liverpool, or even Liverpool's when Arsenal on rare occasions had the ball on the halfway line, it's very similar. The main difference is that Arsenal can't keep the ball as well, and lose it almost immediately which makes it seem like they're parking the bus, but in reality it's more down to Liverpool's quality in pressing than Arsenal's desire to sit back.

cryshol,"Leno - Good. Cant do much about the goals. 

Bellerin - Poor game. Especially First half First goal, maybe a pass. Second goal, Holding is on Mane, don't need two on one. Improved in second. 

Holding - Haters will jump on my back, but bar that one stupid pass, he has relatively kept Mane quiet. Shown strength. 

Luiz- Decent. But for that one misplaced pass and putting Holding under pressure and getting him cornered. 

Tierney - Poor on that first goal. Not been as impactful as he normally is. Passing wayward. Looked poorer than normal passing out from back. 

Xhaka- poor game. 2-3 excellent vision and passes. 2-3 stupid mistakes and slips. Rightly substituted.

Ceba - Arsenal MVP. Comfortable and was bossing. 3-4 excellent chance created. 

Eleneny- Not the impactful player we want in mid. Two good long passes doesn't make up for his lack of press resistance, space creation, ball progression. No mistakes though. Recycler

Willian - Got more defensively involved later in the game. Offensively very poor. Like his replacement. 

Pepe- We have had many a games like this from him. Even when starting. Piss poor corners. Weak dribbling. 

Laca- Made that goal for us and himself. Doing his best from the limited service forwards are getting. Bad miss on that Ceba pass. 

Auba- Surprised to see him, not making runs against that high lines. I mean AMN was making more runs than him. Nothing to do the whole game but defend. 

AMN- And he is not having a good game. 
Both their first half goals from Right to left. AMN being the poorest player for us today. No incision or proper decision  making

• Liverpool was classes above us today. Don’t let my points below fool you I’m believing anything else, absolutely deserved win.

• Ref was shit, I’m ofc biased, but it felt like he was giving nothing to us and every little touch on Liverpool players was given a foul. Can anyone not biased give an opinion on this?

• Laca got to bury his chances, could have been a different game. 

• Auba got really isolated for most of the game, was barely part of it. 

• Hindsight is 2020, but it was painfully obvious Ceballos should’ve started. He was incredible when he came on. 

• We have been fairly successful with playing out the back, but this game was terrible. So many misplaced passes and we really invited Liverpool’s pressure. 

• Leno has been great for us for a long time, but he really doesn’t instill the same confidence as Martinez did. I really hope we didn’t sell the wrong keeper.",2,1601326886.0,,False,2020-09-29T05:01:26

Arteta might have wanted to keep him away from a game of this magnitude to protect him because he's new and it would be a trial by fire but honestly I think he would have done well because he's strong and athletic. Holding is slow and has no ability on the ball which was exploited alot in the first half. He looked better in the second half for the most part because Dani was on and his ball progression at least pushed Liverpool back a little bit so decreased the barrage on Holding that was in the first half,2,1601343105.0,,False,2020-09-29T09:31:45

Even tonight I sort of get the logic, draw Liverpool in and pass through the lines to create space. The press tonight was so intense in comparison to the last couple times we played you guys and it was frustrating we had no plan B.

I think Ceballos made a massive impact but AMN and Bellerin had shocking games. Xhaka too. He seemed more interested in dictating to the players around him tonight than actually getting involved.

Aubameyang didn't seem match fit for some reason, looked tired in his pressing and I thought Willian was caught out of position too often.

If the ref sent him off, VAR wouldn't have been able to overturn it either because there is contact. It's still a 50-50 call which the ref gets to interpret how he chooses. If that was the 60th minute and it was defender on attacker. Even more chance he gets sent.

You might think it's bias, but when you rethink this tomorrow with a neutral starting point you'll know what I mean. If Auba had done it, there's a chance it's a red. If Mitrovic or Diego Costa had done it, even more chance of a red. David Luiz whilst in an Arsenal kit, very likely to be a red given his current red card rate per season with us.

svect,"Since we finished 2nd the season Leicester has won, we have finished at positions 5, 6, 5 and 8. What do you call that, if not mid-table?

Even under Wenger we would play half a season well and half a season poorly, so we would end up finishing around 4th, but looking at annual tables, we'd alternate between 10th and 1st or something. Because we'd have a great first team, someone would injured, and we'd always be 1-2 proper signings away from making a title run. 

The difference is between the time Alexis left until Arteta, we let our first team rot as well, and that's when we became genuinely mid table. We've been improving under Arteta but there is a huge gulf in quality between this squad and genuinely top teams. It will take a couple of seasons of proper tactical training and shrewd transfers to become a solid top team.

**Edit**: to make things worse, during the time we were mismanaging our first team, both Liverpool and City rocketed upwards. City can keep throwing money at the problem and Liverpool managed the club very cleverly. 

Meanwhile, United dealt with Jose and the second coming of Ed Wood, we were rudderless, and Roman decided to chill out for a bit before bringing out the checkbook this year + they are transitioning out of their older squad with Cech, Willian, Luiz, Alonso etc. so 3 out of the old top 5-6 dropped significantly, which softened our drop a bit.

The players are told not to pass until they're pressed, so they commit a man.

Or hitting it long for Aubameyang if the run can be timed, because the line is always high when you press around our box.

Things changed drastically in the second half, they chased more, they lobbed balls over and on two occasions they should have gotten a goal, with all that said, they packed the bus in the first half, there is no question about that.

The ability for Liverpool to pick them apart does not change how Arsenal were playing, it just displays Liverpool's elite ability to break teams down.
