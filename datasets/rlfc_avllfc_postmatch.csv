eurfryn,LiverpoolFC,"**WHAT. THE. FUCK.**

Well where do we start? This weekend looked so promising...

A first PL hat-trick scored against LFC in 10 years? First time we’ve conceded four in the first half since that infamous 6-1 at Stoke? The first time we’ve conceded seven since April 1963 against Spurs? Or the first time both Liverpool and Manchester United have conceded six or more on the same day?

Giorggio360,LiverpoolFC,"Terrible game. You could say we were unlucky with the deflected goals but Villa could have had five more. Literally every single attack they could have scored, our defending was that poor.

The very few positives this game were Salah, Jota, and Robertson. Salah took his goals smartly, and Jota and Robertson were threatening in the first half.

The defending was abject. I don't think I've ever seen any team defend like that. Even in the doldrums of world football or tenth tier teams in the cup defend that badly. Every single player shirked their responsibility to defend past the first goal in my opinion - the defence itself was far too standoffish and were caught in absolutely woeful positions. The midfield too often felt non-existent and didn't bother tracking back enough. In my opinion Van Dijk is also a poor captain since he's too casual - Henderson would never have let standards drop to what they did in this game.

I think the big losers from this game will be Gomez and Firmino. 

Gomez's confidence looked absolutely shot by the second half to the point where he could do literally nothing right. I like him as a player but he's living off of form from the first half of 18/19 now, which is two years ago. I think he needs to spend some time out of the team but we don't have the centre backs to do that.

Firmino didn't have a stellar season. He was alright, I think. It's ok that he's not scoring because he offers other things to the team. But when he doesn't offer those things to the team either, he's a complete passenger. I don't think the pressing was there today nor the link-up play. His sideways dribbling across the pitch before goal 5 (I think) was suicidal. It's not a great look when we've offloaded one of our best young talents because he won't get a game over Firmino. If Brewster starts banging them in for Sheffield we'll look like absolute mugs. Jota and Minamino are playing far better than Firmino at the moment and I think they should get some starting minutes over him in the near future.

I hope this is a blip. It seems like an absolute freak result to me and the players should come back with absolute conviction that this result will not happen again. It was an absolute embarrassment and the only respite for them is that they didn't have any fans in the stadium with them.",41,1601843572.0,,False,2020-10-05T04:32:52

Minamino showed potential. He’s been great in cups and now he showed he’s able to play in the prem.

3 of the goals were deflections. Still goals and they still count but on another day all 3 could have missed.

We have Allison. I know adrian has received enough criticism already but on the bright side he is our backup and if Allison had played 2-3 of the goals wouldn’t have happened.

This crack in the armour was already a problem the last game, which Klopp defended and made plain during the spat with Keane post match.

Aston Villa just exploited this ""weakness"" most effectively. Of course, the early howler by Adrian set the tone. And then, the repeated defections that led to goals totally crushed any remaining confidence.

It is easy for us couch players to analyze and point fingers. No true fans of the team can, nor want to, see such results.

okaysian,LiverpoolFC,"Embarrassing. Simple as that. The players have to own up to it. Adrian has to own up to that shitty pass at the beginning of the game. The other players have to own up to not being defensively disciplined. 

We're seeing the high line get routinely punished this season. It's not just us, but also City as well. Maybe it's the result of COVID and not having a proper preseason or maybe it's the result of teams finally learning how to cope with it, but we need to assess if running that high line is always the way to go for matches.

We have two of the best wingers in the world with Mane and Salah. We can afford to move Robbo and TAA further back so that they aren't constantly making 60 yard dashes to get back to help Gomez/Virgil in defense. 

It's really no surprise that the spaces that Robbo/TAA leave are the spaces their wingers sit and occupy. Gomez/VVD has to run out to cover the run and at that point they have one/two extra players running down the middle to occupy the space that Gomez/VVD left. 

Basically, these problems aren't a surprise. We saw it after we won the league when City tore us apart and we were making elementary mistakes against Arsenal. 

We excused those problems because we chalked it up to us not being focused because we had won the league.

Well, it's a new season and those same problems are creeping in.

To put things into perspective. We’ve conceded from a keeper error 5 mins in to the game. Denied a clear penalty which would have equalized us and allowed us to play our football according to our rhythm. Opposition scored 3 goals from lucky shots which were going wide but took a deflection to go in.

To me the game basically ended after the first half. Because to come back from 4-1 score Klopp had to take a lot of risks, it could have paid off if we’ve scored a couple of goals, but instead they scored with these lucky shots. Play that same game with the same team and formation 10 times and the score surely would be in our favor.

For this specific game, with all these crazy, unlikely to ever repeat circumstances, and extremely risky decision which had to be taken because 4-1 is not much different than 6-1, phrases like “we need to replace our whole backline” are just childish. We probably have the best two full backs in the world and the best CB in the world, only Gomez whom I think needs more progress.

rossmosh85,LiverpoolFC,"Here's my take on things.

1. Joe Gomez may need to be replaced.  The reality is, teams try their best not to attack down our left because Van Dijk is there and also Robinson is a bit better defensively than Trent.  Normally, Van Dijk can play as a sweeper to some degree and Allison also helps with that so Gomez doesn't look so exposed.  Today Van Dijk was occupied with other players in his space which left Gomez 1v1 and he looked really suspect.

2. Aston Villa's strategy was A+.  Long balls from the back to their outlets.  And then their outlets stretched out our defensive.  Our midfield was completely nullified.  Fair play to them because while I'm sure several teams have tried to do this, very few have actually done it.  So you have to give them their praise.

3. I remember when Van Dijk joined and ANY mistake on defense was unacceptable.  I remember players making truly minor mistakes which lead to a poor shot on target and he'd have a look as if the world was about to end.  Over the last 6-12 months, his body language has completely changed.  It's as if he accepts mistakes will happen and not to be too hard on himself and everyone.  I think it's corresponded with some edge lost in the team.

4. As much as the players have to take the brunt, the manager also has to take some too.  We didn't need to lose this badly.  We didn't need to look second best the entire match.  I know Klopp made substitutions and tried to change things up, but he's got to be able to call out to the team to change to a ""Oh shit, we're in trouble.  Get everyone back and calm the game down for 10-20 minutes"" strategy/formation.

Big picture, I kind of always expected this season to be a tricky one.  There's been signs of a decline for a while now.  Even last season when we were winning all the time, we were grinding out results while not playing really well.  It's also just really hard to keep a super high level.  We saw with City last season that sometimes you just decline after being at such a high level for so long.  Still doesn't excuse a result like this.",17,1601846278.0,,False,2020-10-05T05:17:58

Fury_Wolf,LiverpoolFC,"Serious Question:

What's the consensus on Gomez here? Is it the case that that spell he had with VVD prior to his leg break, kinda pulled the wool over our eyes? 

Apart from his pace, in all honesty, when I look at him in comparison to say, Lovren, they're actually pretty similar.

Both would have spells or games where they were amazing (note our CL run in 17/18 with Lovren) - but always had an absolute dogshit game in them. Gomez plays a great game v Arsenal, and then probably the worse one I've ever seen tonight. 

His pace for recovery makes him ideal for the high line we play - but apart from that, he's kind of average defensively - and as we've seen tonight as well as v Leeds, he is very easy to bypass at times.

Personally, when both are fit - I think Matip takes the starting position hands down. He's had games where he's even outshone VVD and his deep passing has been a potent weapon. I also can't recall very many truly bad performances. It's purely his injury record that's held him back.

After this game and quite frankly alot from last season - the trust in Gomez not being a liability has seriously eroded. This may be a reactionary take - but the drop in his level has really made us so vulnerable.

And that high line!?? How after conceding 4 in one half, do you seemingly push up even higher!?? Literally, all they had to do was knock it long, because they had an entire half of the field to run in to.

That was the most shambolic performance i think I've ever seen, and what was more worrying and frustrating was that we literally didn't learn a single thing! How do you make the same mistakes 7 times?

This feeling will fade, and we hope that the players will use this as a catalyst to do and be better - but they've really let us and more importantly themselves down in a big way.

I do believe we will bounce back quite quickly. Thankfully it's only 90 mins and three points. Mane, Thiago and especially Henderson will lift us up a few levels.

I'll make some excuses first. 4 of those goals don't happen normally. One of them was a great goal by Villa.   Adrian made a huge mistake, one he should not be making. Too many mistakes for a backup keeper and we need someone who's a bit more experienced and calmer on the ball. Would be great if we could get someone in tomorrow, but I reckon that's unlikely. The other 3 goals were deflected in, it is what it is. 

I'll start with the defense today. Robbo was trying his hardest. Can't fault him for any of the goals. Joe and Trent were absolutely abysmal. Trent needs to remember that he's a defender. He's too slow getting back and doesn't put in enough challenges. The gap between him and Joe today was our undoing. Joe was absolutely awful and honestly, since seeing him this season, he hasn't been good enough. He's not confident, he's not holding the line and was the fault of most of the goals today. Virgil needs to be that leader and sort that shit out. 

The midfield. Maybe Keita isn't going to be what we wanted him to be? I know, I know, it's just one game. But mate we spent 85 million on him. He just does not seem to have an effect on games like we thought he would. Milner should've been on at half time. Just to calm shit down. Gini, was pretty invisible today and Fab wasn't at his best level. Felt like we weren't playing with a midfield for most of the match. 


Attack. Well done Salah, he was tracking back and getting in tackles, he tries to play of the shoulder of defenders too often, I'd really like to see him challenge for some of those balls instead of hoping for a defenders mistake. Jota, looked lively. Excited to see how he gets on this year. Now people won't like this. But Bobby....I love Bobby. But what the fuck has happened to him, don't tell me it's what he does off the ball okay. I know that. But his on the ball work this season has been atrocious. First touch is non-existent, his short passes have been woeful and ultimately he cost us a goal and missed some easy chances. He's scored 1 in 18........1..... I'm sorry but that's not good enough. 

We need a good CB. We need a better backup keeper. Taki needs a run over Firmino.  

Alright. I'm done. It's out. This shit happens. Villa out played us ultimately and deserved the win. They look physically strong this year.

Even after dominating Arsenal last week, they went through our high line quite a few times. We stubbornly held that we were still winning. Those wins have papered the cracks. They are small cracks that can be absolutely fixed by someone like Klopp. I believe in him. I believe when we eventually fix our problems, we will be looking at this game like the Spurs game of 2017. 

This has already started with subbing off of Firmino. Maybe we will change the system a bit.

wigwar,LiverpoolFC,"International break to let everyone forget about it, then coming back and smashing Everton, is the only redemption here.

For me this isn't just one or two people having a bad game, it highlights a few of the problem areas we have that are normally masked by us controlling games:

1. Anytime our defence is truly tested it comes up short. Teams target Trent and Gomez because they know they can be naive, when teams come at us like today, and Leeds, we are exposed much too easily. For a team that uses the press so much, we are not comfortable being pressed ourselves, we take too long on the ball and can't adapt quickly.
2. Firmino has been out of form for a while now. No idea what the cause is, confidence, complacency.. who knows... Luckily we have Thiago to come back who can take that role of bringing Salah/Mane into play more and make it his own.
3. Squad depth in some areas is an issue. Most of the backup players we have aren't able to execute Plan A in the same way, and we seemingly don't have a solid Plan B for when teams press us effectively. We still pass it around the back line slowly and we get caught out because of it.",4,1601842620.0,,False,2020-10-05T04:17:00

PabFOz,LiverpoolFC,"I'd be curious to look back on the chances that the high line might have tried to prevent and see if it was individual error or  a collective failing. I recall for several breaks for Villa, Van Dijk wasn't even onscreen; seemed like he ventured a little far up on a few plays, leaving Gomez, Trent, and our midfielders to cover the break. We probably should have played it a little safer after going down and make sure our centrebacks can recover. We all know Van Dijk excels when he's in position to run with the striker, but today that fell on players less up for the task.

I'm also a bit concerned with the lack of holdup play in midfield. We have a bit of a height/strength deficit going forward, especially when Henderson is out, and when the passes aren't connecting, we tend to turn it over a lot. If you look at Villa's roster and ours, they are considerably taller, and their players looked fit and quick to loose balls.

It seems like all the top teams in the epl are off. Their energy just seems low and unfocused. Man City looks really off.

Spurs has been off.

I watched american football for a long time. And there's only been 2 seasons where they had to cancel the preseason and summer training. Both those seasons the defenses were sooo bad.

_esvevev_,LiverpoolFC,"I'm gonna TY-up a little and say that this wasn't the worst performance I have ever seen in the Klopp era.

Tottenham 4-1 Liverpool, the two UCL games against Napoli at San Paolo, Watford 3-0 Liverpool and Arsenal 2-1 Liverpool were far worse performances overall, because we couldn't see the box on those occasions. Tonight at least we scored a couple from open play and we created a number of good chances. 

Tonight Klopp got the defensive tactics completely wrong (the line was too high and the offside tactic made it even worse). Moreover, the players didn't look ready to battle up in midfield: most likely they were hoping to push Villa inside its own box like in a typical Burnley game, but that wasn't the case.

Losses like this can be humbling, but they can also be confidence killers.  Absolutely worst time possible to have an international break.  Very lucky that we have great leadership from the staff and Hendo, milly, etc to help build each other back up.

Edit because reddit won’t let me post an answer : 18-19 It absolutely was, even though we won everything last year, to be perfectly honest I enjoyed 18-19 more than last year. 3-4 goals every game, unbelievable stamina and effort shown by the players in 18-19.

In 18-19 we were a great hungry team, we were scoring goals left and right but were still conceding and lost couple of games.

Last year we were a good BIG team, as for me big teams still manage to win even though they don’t play great every game. 

What I meant to say was that even though we were great in 18-19 we didn’t win anything, so there was a reason for motivation especially after that final against Madrid where we all felt like we were robbed.

I truly hate to say this, but Firmino isn't all that important to us anymore. He's been completely invincible ever since the restart and he misses so many easy sitters it's certifiably insane. I always see people talking about how great his hold-up play and ball distribution are, and how he presses so well, but I'm just not seeing it anymore. Taki, Salah and Jota have all shown themselves capable of doing the job Bobby does, and in Salah's case I would even argue that he would do it better. The ""invincibility"" that surrounds him in regards to a spot in the starting line-up is starting to feel ridiculous at this point. As I've previously stated he's been utter shite for ages now, and yet Klopp refuses to bench him. So then why the fuck did we even buy Taki? We spent 10m on a guy to act as a back-up and he's doing a better job than the starter, but for some reason Klopp just doesn't want to give him a start, or any kind of significant playing time for that matter either, since he's basically turned into the new Shaqiri, only getting subbed on with just extra time to go.

I also feel as if this starting XI we've had for the past 2 years needs some shaking up. Gini, Gomez and Bobby (as I've made abundantly clear) need to be tossed aside, atleast temporarily since neither is playing particularly well at the moment, and we need to get Taki, Matip and Thiago in the mix. I think it's time to let some of the ""old guard"" have some time on the bench and get new, fresh and hungry blood in their place.

We're missing a couple of our first team players, sure, but that is no excuse whatsoever to lose like this.

We played poor and we got ripped apart.

But

A goalkeeper error, from our backup keeper, he in theory shouldnt be playing much.

According to Klopp they were offside when they won the corner for the third, but they don't flag anymore - something he complained about after the Arsenal game.

They had 3 deflections for 3 of their goals that all took the keeper out the equation.

There's an argument Salah was fouled early on, I think 2-1 / 3-1 which would have possibly changed the game.

Gomez had a stinker

So, all the things you saw as well – and you can make of it what you want, obviously, that’s completely fine, as always – but for me it’s only important how we react on it. The only problem is we cannot react tomorrow, we cannot react on Tuesday, we have to show the reaction in two weeks. But that’s fine, that’s the situation and, as I said, the boys are very, very self-critical. None of them would now sit there and point the finger at him or him or him – ‘He was responsible’. These boys are very self-critical and they know tonight everybody has his hand in this result. We have to deal with it and we will deal with it. It’s not nice but it’s life and it’s football and that’s it.

Virgil van Dijk: We're all very disappointed - we have to step it up

On whether he felt the preparation for the game ‘wasn’t right’ with injuries and illness ruling players out…

That’s really for supporters and journalists to make of these kind of things, ‘He is not in, he is not in, he is not in’. There is no need for one excuse, absolutely not. Whatever team we could have lined up tonight, I wouldn’t expect to lose 7-2, to be honest – 100 per cent. It’s not necessary, it’s absolutely not necessary. I said it in the beginning and it’s true, Aston Villa did really, really well, but we helped as well. This game then has its own dynamic and then influence goes in that direction, one team is flying and the other team is obviously not flying. We know that, that’s how things can happen – but it should not happen. 4-1 down, half-time, usually you would say we try another five minutes and then we just defend. That’s not us. Everyone who saw the game had the feeling if we score once, then score [for] 4-2, then probably game on, or not. Not if we play like tonight, but if we then can improve in the game then it would have been game on. Nothing to do with the players we missed tonight; yes, we missed them obviously, but it had nothing to do with the result or the players who replaced them.

On whether he spoke to the players in the dressing room immediately afterwards…

Actually, I don’t know since when but already for a while I speak to the players after the game. If we win or if we lose, it has nothing to do with it. I spoke to the boys, yes. When the boys go on internationals, I do that always. Maybe it is slightly longer, but today I did it like last week, the week before, like the last 20 or 30 games. I always speak shortly to the players.

8bitautism,LiverpoolFC,"First and foremost, congratulations to Aston Villa and all credit to Aston Villa because they deserve these three points massively so, because they played a really good game. The strange result is yes, because Aston Villa played really well, but on the other side because we did in different areas particularly bad. That helps obviously not. Tonight, pretty much everybody made massive mistakes around the goals. The first one was obviously Adrian; that was a big mistake, yes, but the reaction on the goal was an even bigger mistake, how we reacted. We have to take risks when we play offensively, that’s absolutely clear, that’s completely normal and that’s football. But you have to protect your risks, that’s normal as well, these situations. And we didn’t do that tonight. That means we had really nice chances, played really good football, came in the box, in moments were undefendable in the box, which is pretty rare. But each ball we lost, wherever it was, was a massive counter-attack and directly a real problem.

Second goal, [fourth] goal was a free-kick, really well done. They were now already quicker in mind than we were, all these things. In the challenges they were more consequent, that all caused us problems. Being 4-1 down, but I think probably even you when you saw the game felt when we scored the one goal, it was like, OK, there’s still something to go for. That’s what we thought as well in half-time, if we can stop doing the under-average stuff or the bad stuff and can improve the good stuff, score one, score two, game on. But this was not possible tonight because we made similar mistakes again and then the deflected goals came in. That’s of course unlucky but is as well, a deflected ball can be completely unlucky; I thought tonight it was a little bit a 50 per cent block, like we didn’t block it properly, that’s why the ball was deflected. We conceded these goals, strange scoreline, but we have to accept that. The only good news actually is nobody was injured after the game.",2,1601851471.0,,False,2020-10-05T06:44:31
8bitautism,LiverpoolFC,"On whether the injured Alisson Becker will be back for the Everton game…

No chance to play against Everton. We don’t know exactly. Let me say, it could have been worse with that injury, that’s for sure. We were slightly lucky but it’s not that he can play against Everton. I don’t want to put a timeframe on it but four weeks could be possible, six weeks is maybe more likely, but I don’t know. We have to assess this thing, that’s how it is.

But not only because of tonight, it’s now easy and people are like this – I’m not sure if journalists are like this as well – but now people will go for Adrian and stuff like this. Yes, the first goal was not cool, of course. But apart from that, I don’t think he had anything to do with all the other goals pretty much. We didn’t help him tonight, let me say it like this, or we even did the opposite. He’s a really good goalie who played 11 [Premier League] games for us last year and I think we won pretty much all of them. It’s all fine. Tonight our goalie was not the problem. Only around the first goal. And the reaction for that first goal was not his problem, that was then our problem. We have to do that better, we can do that better.

It’s quite strange when you see a game like this, not that I saw these games like 20 times from my team, I see all these things and I’m old enough to know strange things can happen in life and in football. But I saw all the things that happened tonight and I know that if you lose the decisive challenges you will lose football games. We did that tonight. If you protect your own offensive stuff not properly, you will get in trouble. And we got in trouble tonight. And all these things happened tonight. You could see in moments – and I don’t think I had to say that a lot – but tonight in different challenges Aston Villa definitely wanted it more than us. That’s something I saw and I don’t like obviously, but now the boys go to their national teams and when they come back – hopefully healthy, all of them – then we have two days’ time to prepare the Everton game and then we have the chance to do better.

On adopting a measured approach in his answers during his post-match media duties…

Nothing what I could say tonight would help with that result. What should I be now? Completely outraged or something like that? Is it only a one-off? I would think so, I would like to think so, but that I cannot prove tonight. If people want to hear it, I can say it: that’s a one-off. The proof for that will be in the next couple of weeks and months and not because I say it tonight. A game like tonight should not happen, 100 per cent. It never happened since I am here; I don’t really remember as I am not good at remembering these things anyway, but I don’t think I lost that high. It’s not a personal defeat, but it’s a massive one.

_avw_,LiverpoolFC,"liverpool have been figured out since last season. Just look at the number of chances they give up every single game. The only reason they don't concede 3+ goals every game is because of profligacy from their opponents. Nothing else.

Liverpool have only 1 style of play. Why do you think Thiago was even drafted in, in the first place? It was to give Liverpool another dimension in mid-field because of how uncreative Gini and Henderson are, which inevitably leads to an over-reliance on the full-backs to get forward, which in turn creates huge spaces at the back, so anytime Liverpool lose possession in an advanced position, they always end up with a 3 on 3.

Liverpool have not only been figured out, they've been blasted apart whenever their opponents have even an ounce of prolificacy.  This season Klopp has tried to play with a super high line to try and get the breaking players off-side when the above situation plays out. On the back of all 3 games that Liverpool have played this season against 11 men, it hasn't worked. Whatsoever. Only reason the Arsenal game was fairly comfortable was because Lacazette fluffed his lines, not once but a couple of times. Which goes back to my first point, that Liverpool primarily depend on their opponent's wastefulness to not concede.

I might have it wrong from what you wrote but did we lose the league already?...I thought there's still 35 games to go. What the fuck ever happened to Doubters to Believers. It is long season, a season where most teams have had their transfers, pre-season disrupted

> losing a tournament are different

Let me offer another example to illustrate what  I meant, lost to Sevilla in the El after a dire second half (I know handballs and all but we were shit) it didn't hurt as much, We also drew 3-3 to them CL because the wankers came out of the second half on fire

if you're shit and you lose, deserve it but you've been good and you lose when that hurts

I remember talking about the performance in the Atletico game (Simeone got the rub of green of luck) and people telling we lost 4-2. we were bad or Simeone pulled one (Masterclass) over Klopp when he himself admitted he didn't and looked lost on the title

It is weird thing people do...denying their own experience of having watched the game and pander to some sort of bullshit narrative to fit in with there emotions or to scoring cheap internet points

I remember asking people more details on what was so bad about us in that game before Adrian fucked us over...not a single one of the people going on about Simeone's Masterclass could offer a single instance of play to support the claim how it was a Masterclass

I said it last season even during his 11-match spell, those Mickey Mouse comps mean nothing to me, the lad is simply not good enough, he is not a sweeper-keeper, can't play it out which is key to our build-up. 

Yesterday, however was not all about him, Trent was shockingly bad again, same with Gomez and VvD was also subpar. Fabinho has not been the same since coming back from injury. Villa exploited our press (if you can even call it that) and attacked Trent's side mercilessly, Kieta should have helped out more on that side, Grealish was left in acres to weave his passes through our highline.

When one of TAA or Gomez have a bad day, it gets shown up badly because it is where teams attack since they usually cede the other side of the pitch to VVD/Robbo/Mane.

The difference tonight was a horrible error giving the lead away less than 5 minutes in followed by some dodgy refereeing that seemed to break the team's spirit and sensibility.

1st goal: Adrian. Nothing more to say.

2nd goal: Gomez is caught wrong side of his man, and fails to block the shot when he gets back into position.

3rd goal: Ball comes out of the box from a corner and no one is there to collect it on the edge. McGinn then hits it really well and gets a lucky deflection off Virgil.

4th goal: We're caught sleeping with our high line on the free kick and Gomez misses his man. The ball comes across Virgil and Robbo in the box, and its actually Robbo's man who puts it in.

5th goal: Barkley and Grealish go round Fabinho 3 times like he isn't there then Trent half-arses his block on the shot.

6th goal: Nothing we can really do about this one, its an unlucky deflection off Fabinho.

7th goal: Milner and Jones lose their headers and Trent is caught wrong side of his man.

spicy_bumhole_breath,LiverpoolFC,"But sitters he does. He also makes goals from nothing . Including sitters for other people. Jota didn't do any of that...in fact, he cocked up at the only times he had to shine. I like him as a player and I think he fits great into the squad..its why wolves were so great going forward- alot like our play style.

Why are you trying to convince us that his display was top notch again??",1,1601850675.0,,False,2020-10-05T06:31:15

Helpopotamus,LiverpoolFC,"Top sides have had dependable but limited players be long-standing parts of their teams since I started watching over 2 decades ago and further back. 

Literally every top side needs players who you know ill be fit every week and get a job done. He's been that for us which I'm not taking away from him, but I am not of the opinion he's some amazing top 5 midfielder which I've genuinely seen quoted here.

He's always been exposed when the team isn't playing well because he's not good enough to change the tone. You would struggle to find a game where the team has struggled and he's looked good. Most of our other starters will have had games where they have played well despite a loss.",1,1601843914.0,,False,2020-10-05T04:38:34
