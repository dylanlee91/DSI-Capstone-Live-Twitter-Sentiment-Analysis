\- Can't play a high line with Adrian in goal

\- Jota's played well, he's tryna link up play with Gini but Gini's not used to it bcuz he's never actually part of much of our link up play and Jota will probably learn that soon

I am not questioning his importance to the team. Nor am I questioning his off the ball work.
 But if he can't score goals, if he can't finish chances, and if he is gonna always pass the ball even if he has an open net right in front of him just to lose the ball in the end, then can we just say that he has lost all confidence in himself to shoot?

TheBloodMakesUsHuman,LiverpoolFC,"At half time, I said I would take a draw by some miracle, but in the back of my head was the notion that maybe we shouldn't make the same mistake United did and avoid a real trouncing. At that point, I think we just had to accept the loss but try to make it respectable. We lost 3-0 to Watford, which was embarrassing enough, and then the 4-0 to City, last season, so sometimes shit happens, but we can at least try to avoid looking that bad again.   


Ultimately, we should have come into this half being a bit more careful, and at least only lose by two for fuck's sake, get one back and make them be more careful. 4-2 would have been far better than this shitshow. Instead we've been humiliated as badly as United were today, this is pathetic. Extremely disappointed in the team, even if Villa deserve the win 100% and so many bounces did go against us (not to mention our horrible errors and frustratingly poor defending in general).

palmtopwolfy,LiverpoolFC,"The reason I completely stopped using Twitter was because of how toxic it was. Honestly this sub is turning into the same. Yes Gomez had a bad game, but last week he was great. Bobby is not harry Kane he never was. He connects play between the midfield and the attack who is without a pretty important player so the back line can key off them now. I mean watch the game they are leaving Jota alone with cash and clogging up the middle to keep Bobby under pressure and yes he hasn’t had a good game but he hasn’t had any space. It would be nice to bring on Thiago who could force them to spread out but they don’t need to, and since COVID is a bastard we have to worry about and it took two of world class players. As for Adrian he is a back up in for world class player and I’m sorry Ali can’t help us on those deflections that is pure luck even though they were in position due to perfectly timed passes that have broke through  that high back line that we use to put pressure on the other team which allows us to use our press. This sub is acting like it’s Bobby, Gomez and adrians fault or a mixture of the 3. In reality this is a team and unfortunate circumstance loss. It’s as much Gomez, Bobby, and Adrian’s fault as it is VVD, Fabinho, and Klopp’s fault.",10,1601841908.0,,False,2020-10-05T04:05:08

He needs to sit out a few games until he recalibrates himself, Matip was ultimately more consistent despite not having as high a ceiling, and our defense was never as good as when we had him in the back around the end of the 18-19 season (though of course the first half of the 19-20 season was also exceptional defensively).

Fabinho playing as CB in a game where we prepared with an extra high line is suicide, not to mention we're chasing the game 3 goals down, Villa is licking their lips exploiting Fabinho with their pace.

It's not lost on me hat Keita's best game for us has been against Brighton. Anyway cheers mate. Thanks for keeping my head off this game.

When he's on, he's the most direct, effective midfielder we have (pre-Thiago), loves cutting through lines with his speed and ball-handling, and playing the final lay-off to the forwards. Obviously, that hasn't come to fruition consistently thus far with Liverpool, but he has shown glimpses in a ton of matches.
