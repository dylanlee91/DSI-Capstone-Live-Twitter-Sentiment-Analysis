IE the difference between the good player and the great player is smaller on the training ground than on the pitch, but now every game feels a bit like a training session.

Maybe the lack of crowds make games ebb and flow less, like West Ham winning big? Teams get stuck in their inital mindset without crowds there to change the atmosphere. Would make Villa's early goal huge.

The short preseason and the cramped schedule will also play a role, but I don't see why it should lead to these sort of results and not scrappy, sloppy 2-2 draws or something.",273,1601842756.0,,False,2020-10-05T04:19:16

WhatsMyAgeAgain-182,soccer,"Two things:

1) Fans in stands literally died for this. It's obviously why all these goals are being scored. Teams have no shame in giving up when they realize the match is over. There aren't tens of thousands of fans around to boo them and to riot in the stadiums when results like this happen.

2) Roy Keane -- the only man on Earth who can be both raging and smiling at the same time -- will be doing just this as he gets his revenge on Klopp regarding last week's ""sloppy defending"" comments that got under Klopp's skin.

3) I know I said it was just two things but in keeping with the theme of the league, I have no idea what is going on this year.

4) OK just one last thing: Bielsa and Leeds probably in the Champions League next season and ~~darkhorses~~ to win the league.

cfcara,soccer,"Not one mention of how amazing Aston Villa played today in the top comments. What an absolute joke these threads are, just memes and shit takes.

Villa played incredible football today. Organised and worked incredibly hard to win the majority of 2nd balls which set them up to get around Liverpools press. The amount of space the front 3 found was incredible, couldn't believe what I was seeing they had a man over every attack and the switch was beautiful at carving Liverpool open.

Never seen Graelish work so hard coming deep and Watkins was everywhere battling away. Barkley too had a great game breaking the lines, could of done more but honestly a very good solid performance from him. Can't remember the guys name who scored the 3rd but what a wand of a left foot he has, seemed everything he tried today came off perfectly and his passing was brilliant.

But yeah very well done by Villa will be exciting to see how they fare this season and battling for top 10 shouldn't be out of reach this season.",15,1601846025.0,,False,2020-10-05T05:13:45

Thesolly180,soccer,"Even before the Adrian mistake I thought we got off to a bad start with how poorly the midfield were organised and I do think that even though there were individual errors across the back line it was the midfield that truly caused the game to get away from us, and it’s where we truly miss so much when Henderson isn’t available and I think Thiago would also be missed. Keita is good pressing forward but I think defensively he lacks a lot, he doesn’t cover the same amount of ground of Henderson and Wijnaldum which leads to the midfield becoming lopsided giving Fabinho more ground to cover. 

With us also playing the high line it allowed Villa a lot more room to move the ball forward and crucially time to pull apart the high line which they did so well. Targeted the side of Gomez and Trent so well, especially with the late runner behind the fullback.",7,1601842257.0,,False,2020-10-05T04:10:57

- Adrián’s goalkeeping ability is being slated, but honestly it was the lack of presence he has that reduces confidence in him as opposed to his ability as a shot stopper

- Gomez and VVD were both pretty dire, and we had no urgency in the transition from defence to attack

- Salah was clinical; but even then both our goals felt so sluggish and that they just dropped to his feet

- Deflections happen, but 3 in one game you have to wonder which deity we upset

Ellllling,soccer,"By far the worst I've ever seen us play under Klopp. Nothing comes close to it. Looked like it was Man City vs Watford out there. It's wild that this same team had close to their best performance of the year just a week ago against Arsenal. Take nothing away from Villa's performance, though. They were excellent and do not look like a side that was an hawkeye error away from relegation. 

Not to sound like a sore loser, as Villa would have spanked us anyway, but luck was not on our side tonight. Three deflections, Adrian being Adrian and Salah denied a clear penalty. Just one of those days. 

I do believe we will bounce back quite quickly. Thankfully it's only 90 mins and three points. Mane, Thiago and especially Henderson will lift us up a few levels. This game would never have gone as badly had Henderson been on the field. I also think Klopp has to seriously question wether to start Kelleher in the derby, unless we sign a new goalkeeper. It's a tough choice, but Adrian is just horrible. Starting to seriously look like the worst player I've seen play for us this century.

ActivateVTECbeat,soccer,"Villa did pretty well in pressing Liverpool and winning the ball higher up the pitch and Liverpool had a really bad off day today in terms of their passing.

However, I still feel Villa were lucky to score 3-4 of those goals especially with the deflections. Any other day that goes into row Z or out for a corner instead of in the back of the net.

Take that into consideration and it's something like 3-2, 4-2, which feels like a more accurate representation of what happened in this game. It's still bad, but not 7-2 bad. So the scoreline definitely flattered Villa a bit.

The game was pretty open, but Villa were more efficient with their shots (the ones that didn't deflect in). Liverpool had loads of chances to score too but they couldn't convert, besides Salah. I also feel Liverpool were a bit unlucky with not getting a pretty solid penalty case with Salah and a couple of key passes not coming off, but that happens here and there.

Overall, Villa had everything go right and deservedly won, and Liverpool had everything go wrong and deservedly lost. But it's just one of those days. I doubt Villa will turn up and smash every team they play, and Liverpool won't be as sloppy and careless with the ball as they were today, everyday.

Aimless_Joker,soccer,"Fascinating insight into the psychology of football in this game.

Full disclosure, I'm a Liverpool fan, we were awful, Aston Villa were the better team by a mile.

So, we started out with an absolute disaster of a clanger from Adrian, giving the ball to Grealish to set up a gift of a goal. The Liverpool house of cards came tumbling down from there.

Now, anyone who has ever played in a game where a keeper has made that kind of error will know full well how it makes you feel as a team-mate. It breeds nervousness and fear in the rest of the team and we saw that tonight. Gomez, who regularly produces either brilliance or dross had a shocker. The normally colossal van Dijk was powerless to do anything. Liverpool's press was non existant and the midfield may as well not have existed.

Three more of Aston Villa's goals had a lot of fortune to them, with massive deflections taking each in. So yes, you *could* put that down to blind luck, but luck only explains it so far. So buoyed by what had already happened were Villa that their players had the confidence to take those shots anyway, and so fragile was the Liverpool defense's confidence that they couldn't help it, or maybe even ended up in the wrong position leading to those deflections. Three times in one game? Probably a little column A and a little column B, if we're honest.

And yes, there were some major omissions in our team tonight, Alisson, Matip, Hendo, Thiago, Mane. That would affect any team. However, this is still a team that should be getting the job done. When your night starts with a howler like that and everyone loses their heads however, and your opponents are ruthless in their capitalisation of that - hats right off to Villa, in that regard - this is what can happen.

Some serious introspective will be required for our lot, and here's hoping Villa can take all the confidence in the world from this performance, they deserve it. Enjoy the night lads, its been a hell of a day.

Now I'll try and sum up each goal scored by Villa:  
1-0: Playing extremely sloppy from out back. Justly punished.  
2-0: Joe Gomez masquerading as an escort boy(?). Well done there, at least.  
3-1: Shambolic defending+deflection = Liverpool having a Bad time.  
4-1: Liverpool defence fell asleep, while also not playing to the whistle.  
5-1: See the 3-1. Again, way too relaxed defending.  
6-2: See the 5-1. Apparently Liverpool took Social Distancing seriously today.  
7-2: 3 touches. And Grealish has acres of space to run into. 3 touches later, he has scored.

Liverpool seemed to think this game was a friendly. Villa thought differently. And Liverpool were punished thusly.

404AppleCh1ps99,soccer,"Back in January of the year 2016, a little known shoddily animated blatant *Madagascar* rip-off movie with an all star cast featuring Rob Schneider, Heather Graham and Ken Jeong called ""Norm of the North"" was released in theaters worldwide. Although widely derided as the worst movie of 2016, it did fairly well, grossing $30 million on an $18 million budget. What critics didn't know, what the movie's creators failed to understand and what regretful audiences would soon discover, was that this movie wasn't supposed to exist. The sheer reality of this films existence contradicted something deep and fundamental in the nature of the universe- something naive and hubristic humans would never fully comprehend. It would be their downfall.

In an instant, a hole was punctured in the fabric of the space-time continuum and Earth, the Milky way and the whole universe was sucked down a dark and twisted offshoot of existence, where nothing was predictable and everything became as bizarre as this half-baked, shoddy, tedious, witless, pointless, people-will-watch-anything-these-days, cancer-inducing, who-in-the-fuck-plans-em', no-wonder-North-Korea-bans-em', why-do-we-even-exist, mindless, repulsive, maybe-climate-change-is-good-after-all, abominable, greedy, godawful, pathetic joke of a windows-98-animated film that is Norm of the North. 

Then what did the humans do?

y33suz,soccer,"He absolutely was world class in 18/19, the best defender in the world by a mile. He’s had such a steep drop off since then though that I don’t consider him world class anymore. I believe that you don’t always have to have multiple world class players in every position. Yes he may be better than 95% of centrebacks but does that mean he’s world class? I don’t think so, just think it means the standard of defenders nowadays is pretty average. 

Yes real haven’t reached the finals since 2018, but that’s not solely down to poor defending, nor is your defence the reason you won the CL. You conceded 6 to Roma in 2018, then next year conceded 2 In both games against PSG, conceded against Napoli, conceded 3 to Barca in the first leg alone. Then in 19/20 conceded twice to Napoli, 3 against Salzburg, 2 against genk across both games and then 4 to Atlético. Very leaky defence over the last couple years,  but because the rest of the defences across Europe are worse it doesn’t look so bad.

I respect your option of course; you clearly watch him more than me as you’re a fan, so your judgement is obviously fair. I really respect the fact you believe La Liga is the best league in the world. For years I’ve been saying this but prem fanboys don’t agree.

The reason you don't see many people here who agree is because English speakers are more likely to support the Premier League for obvious reasons, and since most people here speak English, they think the Premier League is the best. I am all for facts even though people might think Liverpool fans are delusional. 

Now, I agree that the defense has been shaky, but I would argue that our team has never been one to defend as well as some other teams. Our defense is our attack in other words. Secondly, we lacked Alisson this year in the Champions League who I think is one of the reasons we survived against Barca the year before. He is vital to keeping our back line in check. It is a shame Liverpool's back up goalie is so far from Alisson. And lastly, my definition of world class is being able to consistently support your team and carry them to great lengths. Without Virgil, this Liverpool team would most likely be completely lost. And I do not think being World Class depends on the quality of other players because again, it's all relative. You can be world class compared to all the players in a single year and also what you do for your team. Liverpool won the Premier League for the first time in 30 years just this year. On the other hand, a legend is one who will always be known as one of the best players to ever play this game.

Take it with a grain of salt, bit tough for me to be objective with Ross because he’s a actually a born and raised blue, so I’ve got a bit of a soft spot for him in a way, but at the same time he also took the piss big time with the Chelsea transfer.

revanisthesith,soccer,"I agree, but a lot of times the smaller clubs still don't finish those gifts. Hence the consistency you mentioned. How many gifts did United give Tottenham that they didn't score?

Even the good teams have to finish or smaller teams can steal a win or draw. In 18/19 Serie A, Atalanta finished 3rd and Empoli finished 18th (relegated). When they played in April, Atalanta (at home!) had 47 shots with 17 on target and it ended 0-0.

I really have doubts about Fulham, but I think a team like Sheffield United might be able to get back to form and steal points. Last season vs: Chelsea 3-0 win/2-2, Tottenham 3-1 win/1-1, Arsenal 1-0 win/1-1, Wolves 1-0 win/1-1, drew Man United 3-3 at home. Liverpool and City each beat them 2-0 & 1-0. Not that terrible for a newly promoted team.

Yeah, of course it's hard to repeat those performances, but I think someone will. Of course this is all ridiculously early speculation, but Everton has looked good, Leeds looks fun, Villa are on fire, and even West Ham has beaten Wolves 4-0 and Leicester 3-0.

I think we'll have a bit of chaos. It should be fun.",1,1601859678.0,,False,2020-10-05T09:01:18

We refused to let him leave in January when we wouldn’t be able to replace him, and supposedly he struck a deal with Chelsea to refuse to play in order for them to get him cheaper.
