mahmoodhaffy,What a mental first half. Couldn't have gone much worse for #MUFC down to 10 men after Martial was sent off and trailing by three. Defending has been atrocious. They're close to another two signings but neither are going to solve the biggest problem in this team. #MUNTOT,2020-10-04 16:38:44,['MUFC'],31,0,🇿🇦 🇱🇸,,453,164426,2009-06-04 09:52:25
