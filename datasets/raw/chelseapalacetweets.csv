Chilwell looks like he will be massive for the Blues.

Assured performance at the back from Chelsea.

Mendy didn’t have much to do but a clean sheet on his PL debut is good for confidence.

- Clean sheet + big win !!!
- Havertz was good today as was Zouma and Jorginho. 
- Ben Chilwell with the dream debut. A clear upgrade. 
- Disappointing for Werner but he's not a natural winger. 

Overall a great win. We move.

BalleetVert,"Ends 4-0 to Chelsea against Palace.

Chilwell looks like he will be massive for the Blues.

Assured performance at the back from Chelsea.

Mendy didn’t have much to do but a clean sheet on his PL debut is good for confidence.

Where will things go from here for Kepa?
