cryshol,"Leno - Good. Cant do much about the goals. 

Bellerin - Poor game. Especially First half First goal, maybe a pass. Second goal, Holding is on Mane, don't need two on one. Improved in second. 

Holding - Haters will jump on my back, but bar that one stupid pass, he has relatively kept Mane quiet. Shown strength. 

Luiz- Decent. But for that one misplaced pass and putting Holding under pressure and getting him cornered. 

Tierney - Poor on that first goal. Not been as impactful as he normally is. Passing wayward. Looked poorer than normal passing out from back. 

Xhaka- poor game. 2-3 excellent vision and passes. 2-3 stupid mistakes and slips. Rightly substituted.

Ceba - Arsenal MVP. Comfortable and was bossing. 3-4 excellent chance created. 

Eleneny- Not the impactful player we want in mid. Two good long passes doesn't make up for his lack of press resistance, space creation, ball progression. No mistakes though. Recycler

Willian - Got more defensively involved later in the game. Offensively very poor. Like his replacement. 

Pepe- We have had many a games like this from him. Even when starting. Piss poor corners. Weak dribbling. 

Laca- Made that goal for us and himself. Doing his best from the limited service forwards are getting. Bad miss on that Ceba pass. 

Auba- Surprised to see him, not making runs against that high lines. I mean AMN was making more runs than him. Nothing to do the whole game but defend. 

AMN- And he is not having a good game. 
Both their first half goals from Right to left. AMN being the poorest player for us today. No incision or proper decision  making
