TheLastofIsh,"**""If I knew Alisson was this good, I would have paid double!"" – Jürgen Klopp, 2018**

Very lucky Ali was fit in time. But a +1 handicap from Robbo to keep it competitive and high-line hijinks aside, we bossed them for the majority of the match. 

Jota had some absolute golden chances to convert before his goal (*that* peach of a pass by Mo deserved an assist). But the fact that he’s slotted in so seamlessly on the left wing and made himself available in virtually every attack since he was subbed on is extremely promising.

It's just nice to be sat here hearing how them only being 2-1 down and under constant pressure was a good showing. I've never experienced this in my life time and I don't think I can quit it now.

-I am usually not someone to use graphic or vulgar language online, I think it’s childish and gross. That being said. I Diogo Jota’d in my pants

-Who watches that Chelsea game from last week and says to themselves “You know what, trying to be 2012 Barcelona from goal kicks against this Liverpool team is a great idea. Let’s hold tightly to that philosophy.”

-Hector Bellerin is way more concerned with looking chic and trendy than playing football.

-It’s wild how unbothered I am about going 1-0 down in the first half. 10 years ago I’d be losing my mind.

-I’m going to say this one time and promise to never repeat myself: shout out to that referee for doing a great job.

-Diogo looks like the first attacking sub we’ve had in ages who fits into the front 3 in terms of both quality and style. (i know its early days here)

-Alisson making MASSIVE saves at 2-1. 

-Clean shaven Taki is the best Taki.

-Sadio Mane is the best attacking football player in the world, I think.

-I know it’s about more than goals for Bobby, I just want him to score so badly. It makes me so happy.

-Andy Robertson will never let a mistake go unredeemed 

-Diogo J is a cool thing to have as your name on the back of your shirt.

-What a ball from Sadio to Bobby for the shot that was saved wide in the 76th minute.

Alisson MOTM just unbelievably sturdy back there, reading every offensive situation perfectly and snuffing them out.

Joemez was fantastic today as well, probably our best outfield player today. 

The Jota debut was pretty brilliant, he was in fantastic positions to receive the ball and had many opportunities. While on this topic though, I'd like to say that I believed Taki probably deserved the sub in alongside Milner. Taki has been playing fantastic recently, he knows the system better, and his work rate defensively is a known quantity to us and would've been good at that time as well. Also I think Taki definitely creates and finishes (either scores or sets up) one of the 3 main missed opportunities that Jota had prior to his goal. The one specifically was the shot that hit the side netting, I think Taki passes that into Firmino for an easy no-look goal. I know its easy to say that in hindsight especially because Jota does well to put himself in those positions, I just think Taki deserved the earlier shout, maybe I'm biased. Jota definitely deserved his goal though and he was definitely a bright spot after he was subbed in. If he can do that every time he comes on, I will definitely change my tune about who deserves the earlier sub in shout.",10,1601326924.0,,False,2020-09-29T05:02:04

Utter_Perfection,"Van Dijk was incredible today. The diagonals today were something else. Every single one spot on the mark. I think, sometimes, we've gotten used to what a special player he is and performance like this seems routine whereas in reality it's very special. 

Having said that Mane MOTM for me. Just incredible. Was the best player on the pitch. I understood why we had to take him off due to the yellow. 

Alisson two one v one saves were important (even if 1 of them was offside). Could've done better on the goal. But can't really blame that on anyone but Robbo. 

Gomez had his best performance in months. Back to being his usual composed self rather the weak erratic defender he's been lately. 

Trent also had his best performance of the season as well. Robbo redeemed his mistake with the goal.

Wonderful league debut for Jota. Could've had a hattrick. Lol it was quite shameless from Salah to try to take the chance from him but he did make up for it by that wonderful pass to set up his Jota's other chance. Well taken goal. And Salah himself was quite sharp today too. 

Fabinho was wonderful. Gini was good. Bobby was good. All of 3 were on it. I thought Keita was very quite. An average night for him, I'd say. Worked hard and pressed well but not much quality on the ball that we know he has and lost quite a few balls.",16,1601334068.0,,False,2020-09-29T07:01:08

Is Firmino all he’s cracked up to be? I don’t see him doing anything pressing / dropping deep and building play / making runs that the other two attackers don’t do, only he doesn’t score. A couple of seasons ago he was better IMO, but we shall see. Minamino shouldn’t be replacing him altogether by any means.

Alisson is so fucking good.
